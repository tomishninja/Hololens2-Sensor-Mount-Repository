# Hololens2 3D Printable Sensor Mount
A hololens2 mount for the ZED mini(https://www.stereolabs.com/blog/introducing-zed-mini/) desgigned to be printed within a 3D printer and will allow the addtion of a ZED mini camera to be mounted to the top of the hololens2.

## Why would any one want this when the hololens has its own sensors?
By using a ZED mini you are able to off board some of the more complex processing off of the hololens unit over to a PC createing and transfering data to the hololens such as texture data. It also allows you to collect real time data from regarding what the user expects to see. 

## OK but I don't want use a ZED mini, 
The hololens 2 geometry of the hololens 2 isn't exactly easy to determine, This protype required a large amount of rapid prototyping to enable it to be a suitable mount.

So if you want to build a similar project I suggest that you refer to the image below for suggestions

or revert the Fusion 360 project back to its original milestone (v1). 

# How do I put it together?
place the hololens 2 mount with in the holes specified in the image below. 

This system is designed to have M3 size (50mm's for the two on the end and appox 45mm on the inside) screws threaded up the center of the of the mount supports each using a washer object.

It is from here that corrisponding nuts will be placed into the holes provided.

## Is work on this done,
No not quite, while it is good enough currently I belive that some of the mesurements could use some more slack since not all 3D printers are accurate enough to produce this.
Also there were some sub milimeter inaccurcies with the inital product that could use to be fixed with a future itteration. 

work will also eventually be done add a system that lets you view the data from the zed mini within the hololens app it's self with some repairs to the calibration system.
